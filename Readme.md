# Vehicle Counting and Speed Estimation using YOLOv8

## Overview

This repository contains a powerful yet easy-to-use system for vehicle counting and speed estimation using the YOLOv8 object detection model. The system detects vehicles in a video, tracks their movement, and estimates their speed, providing valuable insights for traffic analysis and monitoring.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv8 for accurate and efficient vehicle detection.
- **Tracking:** Implements a robust tracking mechanism to follow vehicles across frames.
- **Speed Estimation:** Estimates the speed of detected vehicles based on their movement.
- **Interactive Jupyter Notebook:** Provides an interactive Jupyter Notebook for testing and exploration.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (3.7 or higher)
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- Ultralytics
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the Jupyter file)

Install the required Python libraries using:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pandas ultralytics jupyter
```

## Files

### 1. `main.py`

The main script for vehicle counting and speed estimation. Run this script to process a video and generate output.

#### Usage:

```bash
python main.py
```

### 2. `tracker.py`

Contains the `Tracker` class responsible for robust object tracking in consecutive frames.

### 3. `jupyter1.ipynb`

An interactive Jupyter Notebook providing a hands-on environment for testing and understanding the code.

## How to Run

1. **Run `main.py`:**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This processes the video, performs vehicle counting and speed estimation, and saves the output in `output.avi`.

2. **Run `jupyter1.ipynb`:**

   - Install Jupyter Notebook (if not already installed):

     ```bash
     pip install jupyter
     ```

   - Open Jupyter Notebook:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

   - Open the `jupyter1.ipynb` notebook, run the cells, and replace the video file name if needed.
